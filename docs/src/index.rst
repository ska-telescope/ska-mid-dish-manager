Description
===========

This device provides master control and rolled-up monitoring of dish. When commanded, it propagates the associated command to the relevant sub-elements and updates its related attributes based on the aggregation of progress reported by those sub-elements. It also exposes attributes which directly relate to certain states of the sub-elements without making a proxy to those sub-element devices.
